# First, Play the AnEasyAgentsInteraction.ipynb

In this notebook, you can learn that how to create Agent, how to use Agent. 

Do not mind if it is 'autogen' based, you can also write codes by yourself to make them interacting, and more free space to customize the flow. 

# Phases

- Phase 1: Create Agents

  No matter which type of Agent you want to create, just do it.
  
  A planner, some assistants, a supervisor, some executor, no matter, just create it.

  In this phase, you just need to agree that, Agent will bring intelligence to legacy object.

- Phase 2: Evaluate the Interaction Context

  Maybe you have realize that, something is strange, of course, maybe not, no matter again.

  Think about the tranditional programming, sorry I call it tranditional programming, it means no AI init in this scene.

  In that type of programming or software engineering, we always try to find something can be reused, abstracted, deleted, cached.

  So how about this time, we reuse what? abstract what? delete what? cache what?

  We need to do some evaluation before we do those things. Which part needs to be evaluated?
